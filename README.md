## Some Basic Docker Commands


### Installing Docker CE in Ubnutu
Apt Package index will be updated
```
 sudo apt-get update 
```
Install Docker CE and Containerd - Latest Version
```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

### Display version & 
```
docker --version  
```

### Displays the kernel version, number of containers and docker info   images etc...
```
docker info  
```

### Command to check if client and server is working
```
docker version
```
###  Pulling images from Repository
```
docker image pull <repository>:<tag>
```
<b>For example</b>: 
```
docker image pull nginx:latest
```
<b> Two important thing to remember </b>
1. If you do not specify an image tag after the repository name, Docker will assume you are referring to the image tagged as latest
2. The latest tag doesnâ€™t have any magical powers! Just because an image is tagged as latest does not guarantee it is the most recent image in a repository!

You can also use ``` docker pull alpine:latest ``` instead of ``` docker image pull alpine:latest ```

### Listing Images
```docker image ls ``` or ``` docker images```

### Removing Image
```docker container rm alpine:latest ```

To confirm if it is deleted you can use ``` docker image ls```

### Docker Container
A container is the runtime instance of an image.

<b>Run a container from an image in an interactive mode </b>
```
 docker run -it <user name>/helloworld sh
```

### Exit from container shell type exit
``` exit ```

Press ```ctrl+PQ ``` to run container image in background.

### Listing Docker Container
```docker ps ```  or ``` docker container ls```

### Run back the container shell 
```docker exec -it <uniq name or id> sh ```

### Stop container
```docker container stop <uniq name or id>  ```

## Some Basic Docker Commands


### Display version & 
```
docker --version  

```

### Displays the kernel version, number of containers and docker info   images etc...
```
docker info  
```

### Command to check if client and server is working
```
docker version
```
###  Pulling images from Repository
```
docker image pull <repository>:<tag>
```
<b>For example</b>: 
```
docker image pull nginx:latest
```
<b> Two important thing to remember </b>
1. If you do not specify an image tag after the repository name, Docker will assume you are referring to the image tagged as latest
2. The latest tag doesnâ€™t have any magical powers! Just because an image is tagged as latest does not guarantee it is the most recent image in a repository!
